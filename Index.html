    <p>An extremely disappointing show from Bangladesh's batters after being put into bat. The early tackiness of the surface due to the morning start meant that batting wasn't easy early on, but it was all about getting through that initial passage.Tanzim Hasan Sakib to Harnoor Singh, no run, beaten on the outside edge! Lovely away-seamer, on a good length and moves away past Singh's tentative poke. Not all that far away from the edge. Sakib gives him a stare</p>
